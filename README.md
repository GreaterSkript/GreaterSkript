# GreaterSkript
This is a compiler for the language GreaterSkript
### What is GreaterSkript?
GreaterSkript (defined by files ending in `.gs`) is a language based off of the Minecraft programming language [Skript](https://github.com/SkriptLang/Skript).
### Why does this exist?
We wanted a way to write Skripts easier and more efficiently. To do this, we are (planning on) implementing syntax from other languages which are more widely used
### Why are the source code and download different?
The source code contains everything from comments, explanations, and ideas from when GreaterSkript was being written (if you plan to contribute, please don't be afraid to show your thinking). The download is one small file which downloads the more compact version of the source code without any sort of formatting **.


** By no formatting, we mean line breaks, comments, and put everything in one file. This is to limit the amount of space the compiler takes up. Please note that this state isn't meant to be read or debugged, but you are free to look through it
